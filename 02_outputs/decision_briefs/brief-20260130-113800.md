# Decision Brief — 2026-01-30

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- Pivot: Exclude WhatsApp/Telegram; all logging and visualization must happen inside the web app.
- Core Value: All-in-one health command center for anxious cat owners.
- Constraint: Automation-first, minimal UI, mobile-first web implementation.
- Goal: Define the logging UX that prevents the web app from feeling "heavy."
- Recommendation: Option A (The "Swipe-to-Log" PWA).

## Options
A) **The "Swipe-to-Log" PWA**
A Progressive Web App focused on ultra-fast ritual logging. Large buttons, gesture-based inputs (swipe left for 'Bad Day', right for 'Good Day'), and instant feedback.
- *Pros*: Feels like a native app, offline logging, fastest entry time.
- *Cons*: Slightly higher build complexity than a basic site.

B) **The "Conversational Dashboard"**
A web app where the main interface is a chat-like terminal for logging, but the results are displayed on a rich, visual dashboard. You type or use voice-to-text directly in the app.
- *Pros*: Maintains the "natural language" benefit without external apps.
- *Cons*: Hybrid UI can feel cluttered if not handled perfectly.

C) **The "One-Page Ritual" Planner**
A single-page application where all routines (meds, play, food) are checkboxes on a timeline. Symptoms are added via a "Add Note" button that triggers a structured modal.
- *Pros*: Easiest to build, very clear "checklist" feel for routine-focused owners.
- *Cons*: Friction is higher for sporadic symptom logging.

## Recommendation
**Option A: The "Swipe-to-Log" PWA**.
If we want to replace the convenience of WhatsApp, we must provide a "one-tap" experience. A PWA allows us to live on the home screen and use mobile-optimized gestures to make logging feel like a game or a ritual, rather than a data entry task.

## Pressure Test
Assumption: Users will install a PWA and use it daily.
Reality Check: If the web app is just a website they have to navigate to, they will forget to log. Option A survives only if the "Add to Home Screen" prompt is the first thing they see and the UI is literally *one screen* with big targets. Option C is too boring; anxious owners want to feel they are "doing something" (logging) to stay in control. Option B is just a worse version of a chat app. Option A gives the "app feel" without the app store overhead.

## Risks
- Adoption: Getting users to actually "install" the PWA.
- Browser Support: iOS/Safari limitations on PWA features (notifications).
- UI Complexity: Balancing "minimal" with the need for rich visualization.

## Next actions (owner + due)
- Ash: Prototype the "Swipe-to-Log" UI in Figma/Code (Due: 2026-02-02)
- Soren: Research PWA offline storage for reliable logging (Due: 2026-02-03)
- Iris: Define the "Visualization" tiering (what data shows up daily vs weekly) (Due: 2026-02-04)

## Open questions (max 3)
1. Do we need offline support for logging (e.g., vet offices with bad signal)?
2. Should visualizations be strictly charts, or something more "humane" like color-coded heatmaps?
3. What is the minimal set of "visuals" that provides psychological relief to an anxious owner?
