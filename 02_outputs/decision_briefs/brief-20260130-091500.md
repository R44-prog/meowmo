# Decision Brief — 2026-01-30

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- Rachid seeks a small, sharp, automation-first product to build and sell.
- Constraints: No bloated SaaS, fast iteration, usable by one person immediately.
- Current status: "Vague idea" phase with empty problem definitions.
- Opportunity: Leverage "Automation + AI" for high-leverage workflows.
- Goal: Lock a product concept to start building.

## Options
A) **The "Input Refiner"**
   - **Concept**: A tool that takes messy raw inputs (voice, notes, brain dumps) and transforms them into high-value, structured assets (briefs, content, specs).
   - **Why**: Solves the immediate "messy input" problem. High utility for creators/founders.
   - **Constraint fit**: Automation-heavy, minimal UI (mostly input/output).

B) **The "Niche Research Bot"**
   - **Concept**: An agent that continuously scans specific sources (Twitter, News, Reddit) to compile "swipes" or "trends" for a specific persona.
   - **Why**: Information overload is a perpetual pain.
   - **Constraint fit**: 100% automation, zero UI (email/slack delivery).

C) **The "Personal CRM Agent"**
   - **Concept**: Automated relationship maintenance (tracking who to reply to, drafting follow-ups based on context).
   - **Why**: "Networking" is high friction.
   - **Constraint fit**: High value, distinct from bloated CRMs.

## Recommendation
**Option A) The "Input Refiner"**
- **Why**: It is the most "meta" solution—you are currently using this workflow (turning notes into briefs). It validates itself through dogfooding. It leverages LLMs' strongest capability (structuring unstructured data) and fits the "sharp" vs "bloated" constraint perfectly.

## Risks
- **Crowded Market**: Tools like AudioPen, Oasis, and ChatGPT itself exist. Value prop must be *very* specific (e.g., "Decision Briefs" not just "Notes").
- **Scope Creep**: Temptation to handle *all* types of inputs. Must allow only specific output formats.

## Next actions (owner + due)
- **Rachid**: Build a prototype pipeline for "Notes -> Decision Brief" (Dogfooding). Due: Tomorrow.
- **Nova**: Conduct a market sweep of "specialized input refiners" to find the gap. Due: 2 days.
- **Soren**: Define the technical constraints for the ingestion engine. Due: 3 days.

## Open questions (max 3)
- What is the *single* specific output format that is most painful to create manually? (e.g. PRDs, Briefs, Tweets?)
- Who answers the "Questions I can't answer yet" (Validation)?
- Is "Minimal UI" a CLI, a WhatsApp bot, or a simple web form?
