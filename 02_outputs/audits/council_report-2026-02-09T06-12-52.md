# Agent Council Report — 2/9/2026

## 🛠️ Change Summary
> Deep consideration of Technical Constraints: Shifting Brainstorming from Video-capable to **Photo-Only** behaviors.

## 🏛️ Council Perspectives

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"Correct. A blurry video frame is an aesthetic failure. We should focus on 'Iconic Silhouettes'—poses that are instantly recognizable in a single frame, like the 'Shrimp' or the 'Airplane Ears'."

### **Nova (Infrastructure)**
"System relief: No video encoding or frame extraction keeps our local-first storage lightweight. I'm prioritizing the 'Glitches' theme—static anomalies are easy to store and index."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical Intelligence)**
"Medical markers are actually easier to audit in high-res photos. Persistent grooming, pupil dilation (zoomie eyes), and the 'Crouch' (potential pain marker) are perfect clinical photo-quests."

### **Iris (Intelligence/Iris)**
"My AI Trophy engine thrives on static scenes. I can generate a'Cyberpunk City' trophy based on a single 'Airplane Ears' photo more reliably than a video clip."

### **Ash (Growth)**
"A single, perfect 'Blep' or 'Standing Cat' is more shareable on social platforms than a 10-second video. Let's double down on 'Glitches in the Matrix'."

### **Kael (QA/Auditor)**
"Audit Pass: We are now firmly aligned with the technical reality of the current codebase."
