# Rachid's Notes

[# Rachid Notes — v1

## What’s pulling my attention right now
- I want to build something small but real that can be sold
- I’m drawn to automation + AI as leverage
- I don’t want a bloated SaaS, I want something sharp
- Cat health routines and symptoms for anxious owners
- **Vision**: Calm, photo-first app that learns "normal" for each cat.

## The vague idea (not locked)
- A tool / system that helps people track cat health routines and symptoms
- The user is probably an anxious cat owner who worries about silent illness
- The main pain feels like the uncertainty of "is my cat okay?" and the difficulty of tracking subtle changes over time
- **Core Loop**: Simple check-ins + photo logging -> Visual timelines -> Vet-ready summaries.

## Why this matters (emotion > logic)
- I’m frustrated with how cats hide pain until it's a crisis
- I keep noticing people on Reddit/forums asking if their cat looks "off"
- I feel there’s an opportunity around peace of mind through simple, structured data
- **The "Vibe"**: No noise, no generic advice, just quiet observation and clarity.

## Constraints (non-negotiables)
- Built with automation-first mindset
- Minimal web app: Photo-first, strictly no WhatsApp/Telegram
- Focus on "visual timelines" and "quiet learning"
- Fast to iterate
- Should be usable by one person immediately

## Questions I can’t answer yet
- Is this actually useful or just interesting?
- Who would pay first? (Owners of cats with chronic issues or generally anxious owners?)
- What’s the smallest version that still feels valuable?
