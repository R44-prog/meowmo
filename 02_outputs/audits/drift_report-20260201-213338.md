# Drift Audit Report — 20260201-213338

## **1. The Drift Verdict**
> [!CAUTION]
> **VIOLATION**: Active scope creep and boundary crossing detected.

---

## **2. Specific Infractions**

### **Infraction 1: Prohibited Feature Implementation (Notifications)**
- **Source**: `00_context/locked_requirements.md:L50`
- **Goal Statement**: `Notifications: No alerts/push notifications in V1.`
- **Violation**: The implementation of `scripts/run_trigger_simulation.js` and the request for "wake-up triggers" for Milestone 7 directly contradicts the "No notifications" lock.
- **Evidence**: `scripts/run_trigger_simulation.js:L94` -> `console.log(">> FIRING EMAIL to ${t.email}...")`

### **Infraction 2: Strategic Drift (Milestone 7)**
- **Source**: `02_outputs/product_specs/product_shape-20260130-154951.md`
- **Context**: The MVP scope is defined as "non-analytical" and "photo-first logging." 
- **Violation**: Moving toward re-engagement triggers before the core "Timeline" and "Log Booth" are fully production-ready is premature optimization for growth (Ash's domain) rather than core utility (Soren/Nova's domain).

---

## **3. Required Rot**
- `scripts/run_trigger_simulation.js`: **DELETE**. This logic builds a "V2" feature (automated re-engagement) that is explicitly banned for the MVP.
- `src/data/simulation_users.json`: **FREEZE**. Keep only for stress-testing UI performance, not for trigger logic.

---

## **4. Self-Correction Actions**
1. **Nova/Atlas**: Pivot back to the **Core Loop** (Photo-first logging + vertical timeline).
2. **Nova**: Ensure the `daily_entries` table has the unique constraint `(cat_id, date)` as required by `locked_requirements.md:L16`.
3. **Soren**: Verify the "Empty State" UI is actually implemented rather than just planned.
4. **All Agents**: Cease all work on "Triggers," "Notifications," or "Re-engagement" until the core PWA "Photo-to-Timeline" flow is 100% verified.
