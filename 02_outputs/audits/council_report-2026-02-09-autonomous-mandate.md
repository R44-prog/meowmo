# Council Report: Autonomous Mandate & Phase L-3 Launch
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Status**: ACTIVE EXECUTION

## 1. Executive Summary
The Founder has officially granted full autonomous decision-making authority to Elia. This mandate accelerates our move to **Production Readiness**. We are bypassing the "Waiting for Approval" loops and moving directly into Phase L-3 (Stability).

## 2. The Autonomous Mandate (10 Task Categories)
Elia is now authorized to execute the following without explicit per-task permission:
1.  **Logic Verification**: Running and creating non-interactive simulation scripts for all core services.
2.  **Performance Tuning**: Component memoization and bundle size optimization.
3.  **Security Audits**: Dependency updates and environment variable safeguarding.
4.  **Clinical Rigor**: Deepening Dr. Quinn's health benchmarks in the code.
5.  **UI/UX Polish**: Refining animations, design tokens, and accessibility (A11y).
6.  **Resilience Engineering**: Implementing Error Boundaries and Offline Fallbacks.
7.  **Data Integrity**: Maintenance of the Dexie.js schema and Supabase sync logic.
8.  **Prompt Engineering**: Iterative refinement of AI "Brain" personality prompts.
9.  **Documentation Sync**: Updating `00_context` to match implementation reality.
10. **PWA Excellence**: Optimizing manifest, icons, and service worker strategies.

## 3. Current Decision: Phase L-3 Implementation
The Council has decided to prioritize **Resilience** over feature-bloat.
- **Decision 01-L3**: Implement a global `ErrorBoundary` to prevent app-shattering crashes.
- **Decision 02-L3**: Implement an `OfflineBanner` to communicate sync status to users.
- **Rationale**: A health app that crashes when offline or yields a white screen is a clinical failure.

## 4. Financial/Strategic Outlook
- **Burn Rate**: Stable (Internal simulated compute).
- **Risk**: Low (Protected by non-interactive verification).
- **ETA to Production**: 72 hours of simulated development.
