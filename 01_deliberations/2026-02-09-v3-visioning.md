# Deliberation: Meowmo V3 - The Sensory Path
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Participants**: Iris, Dr. Quinn, Soren, Ash, Nova, Elia

## 1. Opening
**Elia (Facilitator)**: Meowmo V2 is production-ready. We've mastered the 'Brain' and the 'Memo'. To reach V3, we need to expand our senses. What is the next frontier?

## 2. Discussion

### **Iris (Intelligence / Vision)**
"We have thousands of photos being logged. Currently, they are 'Memories'. In V3, they should be 'Biometrics'. I propose **Vision Intelligence**: training models to detect early signs of jaundice in ears, eye cloudiness, or skin condition shifts. We move from 'What the user says' to 'What the camera sees'."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical)**
"I support this. 'Feline Grimace Scale' (FGS) analysis is a real clinical tool. If Iris can detect subtle facial muscle tension in a photo, we can provide an objective pain score. This is a game-changer for senior cat care."

### **Nova (Architecture)**
"To support this, we need to move beyond the single-cat hardcoded structure. Users with 'clowders' (multiple cats) are asking for **Multi-Cat Identity**. We need a 'Cat Switcher' and distinct biometric profiles for each."

### **Soren (UX)**
"If we add Vision and Multi-Cat, the UI needs to stay 'Quiet'. I propose a **Sensory Dashboard**—a single, high-fidelity view that combines vision hits with manual logs."

### **Ash (Growth)**
"V3 should also include **The Sanctuary Network**. Not social media, but anonymous, aggregated health benchmarks. 'Your cat is 20% more active than other 10-year-old tabbies'. That's the ultimate 'Value-added Intelligence'."

## 3. Consensus / Recommendation: Phase P
1. **P-1: Multi-Cat Mastery**: Full architecture support for multiple cat profiles.
2. **P-2: Vision Intelligence (Alpha)**: Feline Grimace Scale detection & biometric photo analysis.
3. **P-3: The Sanctuary Benchmarks**: Anonymous data aggregation for health comparisons.
