# Drift Report — 2026-01-31

## 1. The Drift Verdict
**CLEAN**: No active scope drift or role boundary violations detected.

The technical architecture and user experience logic remain strictly within the "Lean V1" boundaries.

---

## 2. Specific Infractions

### Lyra Architecture
- **Status**: 100% Compliant.
- **Verification**: Service layers are limited to Cat, Entry, and Photo storage. No analytical service or medical baseline computation nodes were introduced. Roadmap respects the "Skeleton -> Loop -> Archive" priority.

### Soren UI Logic v1
- **Status**: 100% Compliant.
- **Verification**: Interaction flow is ≤ 4 taps. Design system is "Calm" (Eggshell/Steel Blue). No red/alarmist colors. Mandatory photo captured in Step A.

---

## 3. Required Rot
- **None**. The specifications are focused and adhere to the "Visual Moat" principle without adding feature noise.

---

## 4. Self-Correction Actions
- **Atlas**: As construction begins, Atlas must ensure that "Styling Later" rule (from Soren's spec) is respected to ensure functional stability before aesthetic polish.

---

## 5. Auditor's Note
The integration between Soren (UX) and Lyra (Architecture) is seamless. The implementation of "Swipe-to-Log" in the architecture map directly supports the UX intent without adding infrastructure overhead.
