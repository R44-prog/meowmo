# Decision Brief — 2026-01-30

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- Vision Locked: A "calm, photo-first" cat care web app for anxious owners.
- Core Promise: Quiet peace of mind through "visual timelines" and observation of "normal."
- Pivot Resolved: Web-only build, strictly no WhatsApp/noise.
- Challenge: Designing a photo-first UX that feels light but provides clinical structure.
- Recommendation: Focus on Option A (The "Photo-Journal" First MVP).

## Options
A) **The "Photo-Journal" First MVP**
Focus 100% on the camera and timeline. Users log photos with a single "vibe" tag (e.g., Happy, Low Energy, Off). AI analyzes the photo for posture/gaze in the background.
- *Pros*: Extreme low-friction, high emotional value, creates the "Visual Moat" immediately.
- *Cons*: Might lack enough clinical structure for vet reports initially.

B) **The "Check-in Ritual" MVP**
A structured daily check-in (3-5 taps) + optional photo. The focus is on consistency of data across the 5 categories (Appetite, Energy, etc.).
- *Pros*: Better for "Vet-Ready" summaries, objective data collection.
- *Cons*: Higher friction; feels more like "tracking" than "observing."

C) **The "Quiet Observer" Dashboard**
Build the visualization dashboard first using mock data, then work backward to the logging. Focus on how "Normal" is displayed to reduce anxiety.
- *Pros*: Proclaims the "Vibe" immediately; validates the psychological relief value.
- *Cons*: No real utility until logging is built; risk of building a "pretty shell."

## Recommendation
**Option A: The "Photo-Journal" First MVP**.
I pick this because it honors the "photo-first" vision and the "calm" principle. Capturing the photo is the highest-value action for an anxious owner—it provides objective proof that "on Tuesday, he looked fine." We can layer in clinical structure (Option B) later, but we must win on the visual habit first.

## Pressure Test
Assumption: Photos are enough to track health.
Reality Check: A photo of a cat sleeping doesn't tell us if they ate. If we rely *only* on Option A, we build a photo gallery, not a health tool. 
Option A survives only if the "single vibe tag" is mandatory and structured (e.g., a choice of 5 icons). If it's too free-form, we fail the "structured empathy" principle. Option B is more reliable but risks becoming a chore. Option A is the only one that builds a unique moat.

## Risks
- Storage Costs: High volume of photos for a "minimal" build.
- AI Hallucination: AI "seeing" illness in a photo where there is none (or missing it).
- User Discipline: Owners forgetting to take photos unless prompted "quietly."

## Next actions (owner + due)
- Ash: Build the "Photo-to-Timeline" PWA core (Due: 2026-02-05)
- Iris: Design the "Quiet Learning" logic (what defines 'Normal'?) (Due: 2026-02-06)
- Rachid: Secure photo storage infrastructure (Cloudinary/S3) (Due: 2026-02-04)

## Open questions (max 3)
1. What are the 3 visual cues that most often indicate a cat is "off" (ear position, gaze, posture)?
2. How do we handle multi-cat households in a "minimal" UI?
3. Should the "Vet Summary" be a PDF export or a live "View Only" link?
