# Product Shape — Cat Health Tracker (V1 Lean)

This document defines the MVP scope for the initial "non-analytical" build, as governed by `locked_requirements.md`.

---

## 1. Core User Flow

### The First Visit (Onboarding)
1. User opens the web app.
2. Single field: "What's your cat's name?"
3. Landing: The Timeline (empty state with "Log your first photo" prompt).

### The Daily Ritual (Core Loop)
1. **The Check-in**: User taps the large "Log" button.
2. **The Capture**: Take or upload a photo (**Mandatory**).
3. **The Vibe**: Swipe/Tap to select a Mood icon (Happy, Quiet, Off, Hide-y, Energetic).
4. **The Completion**: Record saved. UI returns to Timeline.

## 2. MVP Screen List

| Screen Name | Purpose | Key User Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Timeline** | Vertical history of observations. | View photos newest-first, scroll past logs. |
| **Log Booth** | Fast data entry. | Photo upload, Vibe selection, Note (optional). |
| **Settings** | Basic cat/profile info. | Update cat name, PWA setup info. |

## 3. Data Fields (Exact)

### User/Cat Entry

## 4. Non-Goals (Verbatim from locked_requirements.md)
- **Medical Diagnosis**: No clinical advice, prescriptive warnings, or "Your cat has [X]" alerts.
- **Complex Analytics**: No line charts, scatter plots, or multi-dimensional data viz.
- **Community/Social**: No sharing feeds, "friends" lists, or public galleries.
- **Messaging Integration**: No WhatsApp, Telegram, or SMS-based logging.
- **Multi-Cat Support**: No switching between cats or aggregate views for multiple cats.
- **Medical Taxonomy**: No complex clinical enums (e.g., specific stool types, blood markers).
- **Baseline Computation**: No backend “normal baseline” calculation endpoints in V1.
- **Export/PDF**: No export or vet summary generation in V1.
- **Notifications**: No alerts/push notifications in V1.
- **AI Insights**: No AI analysis/insights in V1.

## 5. UX Intent Notes

### How it Feels
- **Zero Noise**: No suggestions or "pro-tips." Just a quiet record.
- **Visual Story**: The timeline should feel like a photo album of care, not a medical chart.
- **Neutral Interactivity**: Minimal feedback loops. The value is in the *act* of observing and the *record* it creates.

### Guardrails
- Core daily log takes < 30 seconds.
- ≤ 3 interactions per check-in.
- Calm colors (avoid red). No alarmist language.
