# Product Shape — Cat Health Tracker (MVP)

This document defines the "what" and "how it feels" for the initial build, focusing on the refined "calm, photo-first" vision.

---

## 1. Core User Flow

### The First Visit (Onboarding)
1. User opens the web app (PWA prompt: "Add to Home Screen").
2. Single field: "What's your cat's name?"
3. Upload first "Normal" photo of the cat.
4. Landing: The Timeline.

### The Daily Ritual (Core Loop)
1. **The Check-in**: User taps the "Camera" icon.
2. **The Capture**: Take a photo (or upload).
3. **The Vibe**: Swipe to select a "Mood" (Happy, Quiet, Off, Hide-y, Energetic).
4. **The Completion**: Log saved in < 15 seconds. Feedback is a gentle "Observed."

## 2. MVP Screen List

| Screen Name | Purpose | Key User Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **The Camera Booth** | Low-friction logging. | Capture photo, select mood, add optional quick note. |
| **Cat Profile** | Central info hub. | Edit name, view basic stats, export Vet-Ready summary. |

## 3. Data Fields (Exact)

### Daily Check-in (The Base)
- **Photo**: Required (Image file).
- **Primary Vibe**: Required (Scale: 1-5 represented by icons).
- **Timestamp**: System generated.

### Routines & Symptoms (Layer 2 - Optional)
- **Appetite**: Scale (1-5 bowls).
- **Energy Level**: Scale (Zzz to Zoomies).
- **Litter Box**: Multi-choice (Normal, Diarrhea, Constipated, Blood).
- **Notes**: Text (Open field).

### System Learning (Metadata)
- **Normal Baseline**: A rolling 14-day average of Vibe and Appetite data.

---

## 4. Non-Goals
- **Medical Diagnosis**: No "Your cat is sick" alerts. Only "Deviating from normal."
- **Community/Social**: No "sharing" feed or pet social network features.
- **Complex Analytics**: No complicated line charts; focus on heatmaps and side-by-side photos.
- **Multiple Cats (V1)**: Focus on the single-cat experience first.

---

## 5. UX Intent Notes

### How it Feels
- **Calm Colors**: Earthy tones, soft pastels, avoid red/danger colors.
- **Quiet Loading**: No "Processing..." spinners; use "Observing..." or subtle pulse animations.
- **Language**: Use clinical but empathetic phrases: "Something new noticed" vs "Symptom found."

### To Be Avoided
- **Alert Fatigue**: No push notifications by default.
- **Busy UI**: Avoid dense data tables. Every screen should be 70% whitespace or image.

## 6. Success Criteria for Next Phase
- **Nova** can define a storage schema for the photo-vibe relationship.
- **Iris** can draft a prompt to compare two photos for postural differences.
- **Rachid** can walkthrough the app on his phone and feel "calm" in under 1 minute.
