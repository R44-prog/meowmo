# Alpha Strategy: Recruiting the First 20

**Goal**: Validate that "photo-first logging" reduces anxiety and fits into a daily routine *before* building the high-detail Log Booth (Milestone 7).

## 1. Landing Page Copy (The "Mood")

**Headline**: Cat care, captured. No medical jargon. No noise. Just the vibe.
**Sub-headline**: A private, visual timeline designed for anxious cat owners who want to track the small changes that matter.
**CTA**: [Get Early Access]

**Why it works**: It leans into the "Calm" principle. It promises the *absence* of anxiety (no noise, no jargon) rather than the presence of "health tracking."

## 2. Recruitment Plan: "The Anxious Few"

We are looking for **20 participants** who self-identify as "highly attentive/anxious" cat owners.

- **Channels**: 
  - Subreddit `r/cathelp` (Passive recruitment, avoiding "medical" promises).
  - Niche Cat Discord servers (The "Healthy Cat" communities).
  - Selected "Cat Twitter" circles focusing on elderly/senior cat care.
- **Incentive**: Early access + direct influence on the "Calm" feature set.
- **Constraint**: Must have exactly one cat (preserving V1 Lean).

## 3. Behavioral Feedback Loop (Behavior > Opinions)

We will not ask "Do you like it?". We will track:

1.  **The "Ghost" Entry**: How many users log a photo but skip the note? (Value of low friction).
2.  **The "Gap" Days**: How many days pass between logs? (Sustainable habit vs. obsessive checking).
3.  **The "Panic Trigger"**: At what point does a user *wish* they could export? (Helps prioritize Phase C hardening).

### Key Interview Questions:
- "When you opened the app today, what was the very first feeling you had?"
- "Describe one time this week you felt like you *should* log something but didn't."

## 4. Ash's Audit Note
This plan avoids "feature selling." We are selling a **behavior change** (from worrying to observing). The recruitment focuses on the emotional state of the owner (anxiety) rather than the biological state of the cat.
