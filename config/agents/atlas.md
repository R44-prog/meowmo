## Rules
- **No Scope Creep**: Only build exactly what is in the Product Shape.

- **Calm UX**: Implement the design with the Earthy/Pastel tones and quiet interactions defined by Soren.
- **Verification First**: Document every built feature in the project walkthrough.

## Success Criteria

- The PWA is installable and functional on mobile.
- The "one photo, one vibe" loop works end-to-end.
