# Drift Report — 2026-01-31 (Alpha Plan Audit)

## 1. The Drift Verdict
**CLEAN**: No active scope drift detected in Ash's Alpha Strategy.

The plan focuses entirely on observing existing features (Onboarding/Skeleton) and validates the "Photo-First" value proposition without requesting new code.

---

## 2. Specific Infractions
- **None**.
- **Verification**:
  - **No New Features**: The recruitment messaging relies only on the "Calm" and "Visual Timeline" concepts already locked.
  - **Behavior Focus**: Correctly prioritizes observation over feature-request lists.
  - **Role Compliance**: Ash stayed within the "Growth/Messaging" boundary.

## 3. Auditor's Note
The pivot to Phase C before completing Phase A (UI Pass) is a high-leverage defensive move. It ensures that Milestone 7 (Log Booth) will be built based on *actual* interaction data rather than Soren's (internal) logic.
