# Drift Audit Report — 20260201-215800

## **1. The Drift Verdict**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CLEAN**: The implementation of Milestone 7 (Log Booth) is 100% compliant with locked requirements.

---

## **2. Evidence Audit**

### **Log Booth Flow (POI 9)**
- **Verdict**: PASS.
- **Verification**: The Orion simulation confirmed that the flow starts with **Photo Capture** (Mandatory/First), followed by a **1-5 Vibe Scale**, and ends with an **Optional Note**.
- **Constraint Check**: No clinical symptoms, medical jargon, or "diagnostic" fields were added.

### **Onboarding & Identity (POI 10)**
- **Verdict**: PASS.
- **Verification**: Still limited to "Cat Name" only. No email or password required for the local simulation.

### **Timeline Integration (POI 11)**
- **Verdict**: PASS.
- **Verification**: New logs are prepended to the visual feed. The "Calm" aesthetic is maintained with neutral colors and soft transitions.

### **Notification Lockdown**
- **Action**: Verified that no "Trigger" logic was re-introduced. The system remains purely reactive/observational.

---

## **3. Required Rot**
- **None**. The codebase is free of scope drift.

---

## **4. Auditor's Note**
The introduction of the **Orion agent** for QA has successfully separated "Verification" from "Drift Auditing." The system is now significantly more robust. Milestone 7 is officially **CLOSED**.
