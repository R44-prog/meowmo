# Deliberation: Social Health & Ethical Growth
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Participants**: Ash, Soren, Nova, Dr. Quinn, Iris

## 1. Opening
**Elia (Facilitator)**: We've built the world's most stable cat health tracker. Now we need people to use it—and stay. Ash has proposed "Social Health" as our Phase M driver.

## 2. Discussion

### **Ash (Growth)**
"Listen, we have these surreal AI Trophies. They are beautiful. Currently, they are locked in the user's phone. We need a 'Share to Instagram/X' button that generates a high-fidelity image with a Meowmo watermarked link. This creates a viral loop that brings new users into the Calm Observation mindset."

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"Wait, Ash. We promised 'Quiet observation'. If we add a viral sharing loop, we risk turning a peaceful health app into a dopamine-seeking social network. If we share, it must be the *cat's* achievement, not a 'Look at my score' leaderboard."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical Intelligence)**
"Sharing clinical data is risky. A user might share a 'Hide-y' vibe trophy without realizing it's a warning sign. Any shareable content MUST include a footnote that health tracking is individual and clinical insights should go to a vet, not social media."

### **Nova (Infrastructure)**
"From a tech side, we need dynamic Open Graph images. I can set up a serverless function that renders the AI Trophy + Cat Name into a unique URL. IndexedDB handles the local part, but cloud-sync is mandatory for this to work."

### **Iris (Intelligence)**
"If we share, let's share *insights*. 'Luna has been 10% more energetic this week' is more valuable than a random trophy. Let's make the shareable content 'Health Milestone' cards."

## 3. Consensus / Recommendation (The "Quiet Sharing" Principle)
1. **The Trophy Showcase**: A beautiful, public-but-anonymous URL for each trophy. (Nova's Lead)
2. **Clinical Safeguards**: All shares are watermarked with a "Not Medical Advice" disclaimer and a link to professional resources. (Dr. Quinn's Lead)
3. **No Social Feed**: We won't build a feed inside Meowmo. We will empower users to share *outside* while keeping our app a sanctuary. (Soren's Lead)
4. **Growth Reward**: Sharing a trophy grants a "Community Sparkle" (Purely cosmetic micro-animation). (Ash's Lead)
