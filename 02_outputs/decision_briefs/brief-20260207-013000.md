# Decision Brief — 2026-02-07

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Analyzed top cat app (Other app) using full 6-lever engagement playbook (gamification, FOMO, leaderboards, mission).
- **Strategic Fork**: Can we beat them at their game (global tracking + competition) OR create differentiated value?
- **Core Insight**: Behavior observation challenges (photo scavenger hunt) > geographic cat finding. Depth vs. breadth.
- **New Hook**: AI-generated "compilation rewards" (user cats together in absurd scenes) as viral/shareable trophy moments.
- **Recommendation**: Adopt hybrid approach—use engagement playbook mechanics but with behavior-first positioning.

## Options

### A) **Pure "Calm Observation" (Original Vision)**
Stay true to photo-journal + health tracking. No challenges, no gamification, no social features.
- *Pros*: Philosophically aligned. No toxic engagement mechanics. Premium positioning.
- *Cons*: Low virality. Slow growth. Can't compete for attention against Other app's 6-lever playbook.

### B) **Hybrid "Behavior Challenge" Model (Proposed)**
Photo scavenger hunt for cat behaviors ("Catch them loafing," "mid-yawn," "grooming"). Challenges drive engagement. AI compilations as shareable rewards.
- *Pros*: Uses proven engagement mechanics. Unique positioning (behavior > location). Viral sharing via AI scenes. Works for owned cats AND strays.
- *Cons*: Adds complexity. Requires AI image generation. Could drift toward gamification if not careful.

### C) **Direct Competition Clone**
Build leaderboards, global cat finding, badges for quantity of cats discovered (like Other app).
- *Pros*: Proven playbook. Fast user acquisition if executed well.
- *Cons*: No differentiation. Late to market. Not aligned with "calm" vision.

## Recommendation

**Option B: Hybrid "Behavior Challenge" Model**.

This approach uses psychological engagement mechanics (collection, variable rewards, achievements) but positions us differently: **"Other app helps you find every cat in the world. We help you understand the cats in YOUR life."**

### How the 6-Lever Playbook Adapts:

| Lever | Other App | Our Hybrid Approach |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Mission** | "Find all strays to save them" | "Become a cat behavior expert" |
| **Gamification** | Public leaderboards | Private achievements per cat |
| **Social** | Global community maps | Collaborative AI compilations |
| **Variable Rewards** | Random cat encounters | Unpredictable behavior moments |
| **Collection** | Every cat in the world | Complete behavior catalog per cat |
| **FOMO** | Missing cat alerts | Daily challenges, AI compilation unlocks |

### Core Features (Behavior-Driven):

1. **Photo Challenges**: "Capture Mittens loafing," "mid-zoomie," "grooming," etc.
2. **Cat Personality Profiles**: Behaviors build toward insights ("68% playful, 92% food-motivated")
3. **AI Compilation Rewards**: Completing challenges unlocks AI-generated scenes (your cat + others in flying cars, space missions, etc.)
4. **Health Integration**: "Positive flags" ("Grooming frequency increased—could be stress or extra cleanliness. Here's what to watch for...")
5. **Unlimited Cats**: Manual tagging + optional AI recognition (like Photos app face detection)

### What Makes This Viable:

- **Works for any cat relationship**: Owners, stray feeders, casual encounters
- **Forces observation**: You can't control when the cat does the behavior = creates bonding time
- **Shareable trophy moments**: AI compilations = organic social media distribution
- **Not directly competing**: Different value prop than "find more cats than others"

## Pressure Test

**Assumption**: Behavior challenges drive engagement as effectively as leaderboards.

**Reality Check**: Leaderboards exploit social comparison anxiety (proven). Behavior challenges rely on intrinsic motivation (collecting moments) + AI reward novelty. This is LESS proven but more differentiated.

**Risk**: If AI compilations don't go viral early, we lose the acquisition flywheel. Other app has network effects from day 1 (more users = more cats on map). We need compilations to substitute for that network effect.

**Mitigation**: Seed AI scenes with stock cat photos until critical mass. Start with solo rewards (just your cat in a scene) before multi-user compilations.

## Risks

- **Feature Creep**: Adding challenges could undermine "calm" vision if not carefully designed.
- **AI Generation Quality**: If compilations look bad/creepy, they won't share well.
- **Cold Start**: Need enough users for multi-cat compilations to feel meaningful.
- **Privacy/Consent**: User photos appearing in others' compilations requires clear opt-in.
- **Health Liability**: "Positive framing" of health flags could miss serious issues. Need legal review.

## Next actions (owner + due)

- **Soren**: Review this proposal against "calm observation" principles. Can behavior challenges coexist with the vision? (Due: 2026-02-08)
- **Ash**: Spec out challenge taxonomy (how many behaviors? categories? difficulty tiers?). (Due: 2026-02-09)
- **Iris**: Research AI image generation APIs for compilations (Midjourney API? DALL-E? Stable Diffusion?). (Due: 2026-02-09)
- **Nova**: Security/privacy model for user photos in compilations. Opt-in framework. (Due: 2026-02-10)
- **Founder**: Decide if this aligns with your vision OR if we stay pure Option A.

## Open questions (max 3)

1. **Vision Alignment**: Does adding "challenges" fundamentally break the "quiet observation" mission, or can they coexist if designed thoughtfully?
2. **AI Compilation Tone**: Should these be surreal/funny OR artistic/beautiful? (Funny = viral, Beautiful = premium brand)
3. **Monetization Impact**: Does this change the premium tier value prop? (Free = basic challenges, Premium = AI compilations + advanced insights?)

**Council Vote Required**: Does this proposal move forward to prototyping, or do we reject it to protect the calm vision?
