# Drift Report — 2026-01-30

## 1. The Drift Verdict
**CLEAN**: No active scope drift or role boundary violations detected.

The transition to the "Lean V1" scope has been successfully executed across both Product and Technical specifications.

---

## 2. Specific Infractions

### Product Shape v1 Lean
- **Status**: 100% Compliant.
- **Verification**: Onboarding is limited to Cat Name only. Photos are mandatory. Analytical features are explicitly moved to Non-Goals.

### Nova Foundation
- **Status**: 100% Compliant.
- **Verification**: Data model accurately reflects the V1 Lean schema. Storage strategy (signed uploads) is implemented without unnecessary complexity. Baseline computation is explicitly excluded in the self-check.

---

## 3. Required Rot
- **None**. All recent outputs (Soren/Nova) are stripped of "drift" from the previous analytical-heavy phase.

---

## 4. Self-Correction Actions
- **System**: Ensure all future agent executions (Iris, Ash) use `00_context/locked_requirements.md` as their primary anchor to maintain this clean state.

---

## 5. Auditor's Note
The agents show high "Drift Awareness." Nova’s inclusion of a "Drift Self-Check" section is a recommended pattern for all future technical outputs.
