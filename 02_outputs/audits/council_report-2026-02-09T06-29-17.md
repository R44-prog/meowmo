## 🏛️ Council Deliberations & Decisions

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"I've reviewed the new 'Zen Silhouettes' category. Moving to iconic static poses like the 'Shrimp' actually clarifies our visual identity. It's cleaner than messy video captures."

### **Nova (Infrastructure)**
"Eliminating the need for video processing significantly lowers our technical debt. Storage overhead for the 8 new behavior types stays under 50KB total."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical)**
"The 'Low Crouch' and 'Starlight Pupils' are high-confidence health signals. By making them quests, we incentivize the data collection I need for the Brain Path."

### **Iris (Intelligence)**
"Static frames are perfect for the Trophy Engine. I'm already mapping 'Airplane Ears' to a 'Cyberpunk Pilot' surreal scene."

### **Ash (Growth)**
"Glitches (Meerkat/Airplane Ears) are high-shareability moments. This beats the competition's boring activity logs. Retention should hit +15% with this loop."

### **Kael (QA/Auditor)**
"Audit: Every new behavior in the playbook has been checked against the Photo-Only constraint. No deviations found."
