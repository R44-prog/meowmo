# Deliberation: Anomaly Detection UI & Clinical Clarity
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Participants**: Iris, Dr. Quinn, Soren, Ash

## 1. Opening
**Elia (Facilitator)**: We have the `HealthAnalysisService`. Now we need to make those insights discoverable. Iris and Dr. Quinn, how do we present "Anomaly Detection" without causing user panic?

## 2. Discussion

### **Iris (Intelligence)**
"The UI should feel like a 'Weather Report' for your cat's health. Not a crisis center, but a calm summary of patterns. I propose a 'Health Pulse' indicator at the top of the Insights page. If everything is normal, it stays in a 'Stable' state. If an anomaly is detected, it gently transitions to an 'Attention' state with a clear call to action."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical Intelligence)**
"Clarity is key. If Pattern 1 (Silent Pain) is detected, the card must show the *why* and the *what now*. We need a direct 'Prepare for Vet' button that generates a summary of the related entries to show to a professional."

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"Visual aesthetics must remain 'Calm'. No red flashing lights. Use amber for attention and soft blue for info. The typography should be readable and the spacing generous. We're building a sanctuary, remember?"

### **Ash (Growth)**
"Retention is driven by 'Aha!' moments. If the app predicts a mood shift before the owner notices, that's magic. We should have a 'Share Insight' button too—but only for positive or interesting patterns, never for clinical warnings."

## 3. Consensus / Recommendation
1. **The Health Pulse**: A top-level status bar on the Insights page. (Iris's Lead)
2. **Insight Cards**: Detailed, clinical-but-gentle cards for specific patterns. (Dr. Quinn's Lead)
3. **Vet Checklist**: A feature to "package" related entries into a vet-ready summary. (Dr. Quinn's Lead)
4. **Subtle Animations**: Micro-transitions for state changes to maintain the 'Calm' aesthetic. (Soren's Lead)
