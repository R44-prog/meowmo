# Deliberation: The Vet Handoff (Professional Clinical Reporting)
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Participants**: Dr. Quinn, Iris, Soren, Elia

## 1. Opening
**Elia (Facilitator)**: We're building the "Vet Handoff." Dr. Quinn, what does a veterinarian *actually* want to see when a client brings in their phone?

## 2. Discussion

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical Intelligence)**
"Structure is everything. Vets have very little time. We don't want a raw list of 50 notes. We want a 'Clinical Summary' upfront:
1. **The Lead**: Primary concerns or anomalies detected.
2. **The Metrics**: Average appetite and litter trends.
3. **The Data**: A compact list of recent logs with photos.
It needs to look professional, almost like a medical record, not a social media feed."

### **Iris (Intelligence)**
"I can generate a 'Pattern Summary' section that synthesizes all current insights into 3 bullet points. For example: 'Detected 15% appetite drift over 14 days; Hiding behavior noted 3x; Vibe stable at 2.1'."

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"The visual design should be high-contrast, black and white, and optimized for both mobile viewing (screen showing) and PDF export. No unnecessary gradients or surreal floating elements here—this is the 'Serious' side of Meowmo."

### **Elia (Synthesis)**
"Agreed. We'll implement a `VetReportGenerator` that outputs a structured JSON or HTML payload. We'll also add a 'Vet Mode' toggle or a specific 'Generate Report' button on the Insights page."

## 3. Consensus / Recommendation
1. **Structured Layout**: Intro (Summary) -> Metrics (Graphs/Trends) -> Evidence (Detailed Logs).
2. **Professional PDF**: Ensure the export is printable and looks like a clinic record.
3. **QR Code Strategy**: (Future) A QR code that a vet can scan to view the full interactive dashboard securely.
