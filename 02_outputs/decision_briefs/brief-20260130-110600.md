# Decision Brief — 2026-01-30

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- Target: Anxious cat owners who worry about "silent illness" and lack of routine visibility.
- Core Value: Peace of mind through simple, structured health data logging.
- Constraint: Automation-first, minimal UI, fast to iterate.
- Goal: Move from a vague idea to a sharp, sellable MVP.
- Recommendation: Focus on Option A (Symptom Log) but with a "WhatsApp-first" twist to minimize friction.

## Options
A) **The "Silent Pain" Symptom Log (WhatsApp-First)**
A hyper-focused logging tool for physical/behavioral changes. No app. Users send a text or photo to a WhatsApp bot (e.g., "limping", "vomit", photo of litter box). AI categorizes and timestamps.
- *Pros*: Zero friction, high utility for anxious owners, automation-heavy.
- *Cons*: Highly dependent on user consistency.

B) **The "Smart Routine" Integrator**
A system that acts as a central hub for smart feeders, fountains, and litter boxes. It alerts owners if "Fluffy haven't eaten in 6 hours" or "Water intake is down 20% today."
- *Pros*: Objective data, less manual logging.
- *Cons*: High barrier to entry (requires hardware), complex to build/integrate.

C) **The "Vet-Ready" Wellness Reporter**
A tool designed to generate a 3-page "Health Snapshot" for vet visits. It prompts users once a week with specific clinical questions (weight, appetite, mobility) and collates them into a professional PDF.
- *Pros*: Clear monetization (one-time report fee), high trust.
- *Cons*: Low engagement (weekly vs daily), doesn't solve daily anxiety.

## Recommendation
**Option A: The "Silent Pain" Symptom Log (WhatsApp-First)**. 
I pick this because it hits all constraints: minimal UI (no app), automation-first (AI parsing), and fast to iterate. It addresses the emotional core (anxiety) by providing an immediate, low-friction vent for the owner's worries.

## Pressure Test
Assumption: Anxious owners want another log.
Reality Check: Most logs are abandoned in 3 days because they feel like homework. 
Option A survives only if the "logging" takes <5 seconds and feels like talking to a friend. If we build a dashboard, it fails. If we build a *chat partner*, it might win. Option B is a "rich person" gimmick and Option C is too infrequent to build a habit. Option A is the only one that builds the data moat needed for more advanced features later.

## Risks
- Data Privacy: Users sharing sensitive (though pet-related) info over WhatsApp.
- Accuracy: AI misinterpreting "he looks sad" as a clinical symptom.
- Platform Risk: Dependence on WhatsApp/Twilio APIs.

## Next actions (owner + due)
- Rachid: Setup a simple Twilio WhatsApp sandbox (Due: 2026-02-01)
- Iris: Design the core 5 "red flag" symptoms to track (Due: 2026-02-02)
- Ash: Script the conversational flow for the AI parser (Due: 2026-02-03)

## Open questions (max 3)
1. What is the #1 symptom that drives an owner to call a vet (the "Holy Grail" data point)?
2. Is WhatsApp the right platform, or is Telegram/Discord better for privacy-conscious users?
3. How do we prevent this from becoming a diagnostic tool that carries medical liability?
