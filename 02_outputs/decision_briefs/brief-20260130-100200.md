# Decision Brief — 2026-01-30

## Summary (max 5 bullets)
- **CRITICAL PIVOT**: The previous recommendation ("Input Refiner") has been flagged as a "Wrapper Trap".
- It relies on functionality that LLMs will offer natively for free.
- We are pivoting the focus from "Utility" (better inputs) to "Value" (proprietary insights).
- New Goal: Build a system that generates *new* information, not just reformats old information.

## Options
A) **The "Input Refiner"**
   - **Concept**: A tool that transforms messy notes/audio into structured assets.
   - **Critique**: This is a commodity. "Make this cleaner" is the default use case for every LLM. Zero moat.

B) **The "Niche Research Bot"**
   - **Concept**: An automated agent that scans specific sources to compile unique trends/swipes.
   - **Why**: It reduces noise. It creates a data asset that doesn't exist elsewhere.

C) **The "Personal CRM Agent"**
   - **Concept**: Automated relationship maintenance and follow-up drafting.
   - **Why**: High pain, but high "trust barrier" and potential for "bloat".

## Recommendation
**Option B) The "Niche Research Bot"**

**Why**: 
I am rejecting Option A. **Do not build the Input Refiner.** It will feel magical for one week and useless the next when model capabilities improve.
Option B is the superior "Small Product". It sells a clear outcome: "Stop Doomscrolling, Get the Signal." It leverages automation to do work the human *cannot* do (scanning 1000s of posts), rather than work the human *won't* do (editing notes). It is defensible, sellable, and high-leverage.

## Risks
- **Data Quality**: If the bot returns garbage/noise, trust is lost instantly. Requires tight prompt engineering.
- **Platform Risk**: Twitter/Reddit API changes could kill the data source. (Mitigation: Use multiple sources/scraping).

## Next actions (owner + due)
- **Rachid**: Identify *one* specific niche high-value topic (e.g. "SaaS Pricing Changes" or "React Server Components"). Due: Tomorrow.
- **Soren**: Build a quick "scraper-to-summary" pipeline for that one topic. Due: 2 days.
- **Iris**: Interview 3 potential users who consume this content manually today. Due: 3 days.

## Open questions (max 3)
- What is the specific "niche" that Rachid cares enough about to curate the initial quality?
- Can we deliver this via email/newsletter first (Zero UI)?
- How much "human-in-the-loop" is needed before the bot is autonomous?
