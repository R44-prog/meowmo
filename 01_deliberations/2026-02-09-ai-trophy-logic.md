# Deliberation: AI Trophy Generation Logic (Phase L-2)
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Participants**: Soren, Iris, Ash, Dr. Quinn, Nova

## 1. Opening
**Elia (Facilitator)**: The Founder has mandated the "Council Chamber" protocol. Today we deliberate on the implementation of the `TrophyGenerator` service. We have a basic prototype, but we need to finalize the "Surrealism" vs "Clinical Accuracy" trade-off.

## 2. Discussion

### **Iris (Intelligence)**
"I've prototyped the surreal scenes. My vision is that a 'Loaf' becomes a floating island. It creates a viral 'Wow' factor. However, I need to know if the image generation should include clinical markers."

### **Soren (Product/UX)**
"The visual elegance MUST come first. If we show a cat as a floating island, it should still look like *their* cat. We need a way to pass specific cat features (colors, patterns) into the prompt. A generic cat breaks the emotional bond."

### **Dr. Quinn (Clinical Intelligence)**
"I have a concern. If we use surrealism to hide the cat's actual pose, we lose the health baseline. If a cat is splooting due to joint pain, and we turn it into a majestic 'Saturn Stretch', we might be gamifying a medical warning. We MUST ensure the trophy description still references the health value of the capture."

### **Ash (Growth)**
"The viral loop depends on the 'majesty'. Generic 'Health Captured' badges won't be shared. I suggest we include a 'Health Insight' snippet *behind* the trophy. Share the image, but keep the data in the app."

### **Nova (Infrastructure)**
"API costs are the constraint. Generating a unique DALL-E image for every log is unsustainable. I propose a 'Tiered Reward' system. Milestone behaviors get unique AI trophies; daily repeats get high-quality CSS-based badges."

## 3. Consensus / Recommendation
1. **Hybrid Visuals**: Use AI for major milestones, CSS/SVG templates for daily logs to manage costs (Nova's Lead).
2. **Contextual Metadata**: Every AI trophy must carry a 'Clinical Footnote' explaining why the behavior is healthy (Dr. Quinn's Lead).
3. **Personalization**: Prompts must include cat name and color traits to maintain the bond (Soren's Lead).
