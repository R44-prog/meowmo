# Product Promise — Cat Health Tracker

## The Core Value
We provide **quiet peace of mind**. Instead of guessing if your cat is "okay," you have a visual history of their "normal" behavior.

## User Persona: The Quietly Anxious Owner
They don't want clinical charts or loud alerts. They want a space that feels as calm as their cat’s nap time. They care about subtle changes—the way their cat sits, their gaze, their appetite.

## The Visual Moat
By focusing on **photos**, we capture data that words miss. A "photo-first" approach allows owners to side-by-side compare "Last Month" vs "Today" without needing to remember every detail.

## The Promise
1. **Zero Noise**: No generic advice. Only what’s normal for *your* cat.
2. **Clinical Clarity**: Transform simple check-ins into professional reports for your vet.
3. **Effortless History**: Log a photo and a mood in 3 seconds.
